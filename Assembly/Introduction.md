# Introduction to Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is specific to a computer architecture. It is used to write programs that are closely related to the machine code instructions executed by the CPU.

## History

Assembly language has been used since the early days of computing. It provides a way to write human-readable code that can be directly translated into machine code.

## Use Cases

- System programming
- Embedded systems
- Performance-critical applications
