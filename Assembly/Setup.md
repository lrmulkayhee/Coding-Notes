# Setting Up Your Assembly Language Environment

## Install an Assembler

You need an assembler to convert assembly code into machine code. Popular assemblers include:

- **NASM (Netwide Assembler)**: [NASM Website](https://www.nasm.us/)
- **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)**: [MASM Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/assembler/masm/)

## Set Up Your Environment

1. **Download and Install the Assembler**: Follow the instructions on the assembler's website to download and install it.
2. **Configure Your Development Environment**: Set up paths and environment variables as needed.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal and run the assembler's version command to verify the installation (e.g., `nasm -v` for NASM).
